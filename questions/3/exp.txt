1.-> cd ~ moves you to your home directory, where you’re allowed to experiment without breaking civilization.
echo ... > sample_data.txt creates the file and writes text into it.

2.-> ln creates a hard link.
Both filenames now point to the same inode.

3.-> -s creates a symbolic link.
This is basically a shortcut containing the path to the original file, not the data itself.

4.-> -i shows inode numbers.
-> -l gives detailed listing.

5.-> sample_data.txt and sample_hard.txt will have the same inode number.
Reason:- A hard link is just another name for the same inode on disk.

->sample_soft.txt will have a different inode number.
->Reason:- A symbolic link is a separate file that stores the path to the original file, not the data.

6.-> ls -l shows permissions, owner, group, size, and timestamps.
-> stat goes full detective mode: inode number, link count, access, modify, and change times.

7.-> du shows disk usage.
-> -s gives a summary.
-> -h makes it readable by humans instead of machines with trust issues.

8.-> -h makes file sizes readable.
You now know exactly how much space your life choices are taking.

9.-> Removing a symbolic link does not affect the original file.

10.-> du -h ~ shows disk usage of all subdirectories.
-> du -sh ~ shows total usage only.
-> --max-depth=1 limits how deep Linux rambles.
